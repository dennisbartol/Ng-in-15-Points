<b>1. Introduction to Angular:</b></br>
Angular is a frontend framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and facilitates the development process with its rich set of features.


<b>2. Setting Up Angular Development Environment:</b></br>
To set up Angular development, you need to install Node.js and Angular CLI. Angular CLI simplifies the process of creating and managing Angular projects. Here's a command to install Angular CLI:
<code>
  npm install -g @angular/cli
</code>


<b>3. Components and Templates:</b></br>
Components are the building blocks of Angular applications. They consist of a TypeScript class and an HTML template. Here's an example of a simple component.</br>
Typescript:</br>
<code>// app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'My Angular App';
}
</code>

HTML:
<code>
&lt;!-- app.component.html --&gt;
&lt;h1>{{ title }} &lt;/h1>
</code>

<b>4. Data Binding:</b></br>
Angular provides various types of data binding like interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding. Here's an example of interpolation:




<b>5. Directives:</b></br>
Directives are markers on a DOM element that tells Angular to do something with that DOM element. Angular provides built-in directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitch. Here's an example of ngFor directive:



<b>6. Services and Dependency Injection:</b></br>
Services are used to encapsulate reusable logic in Angular. Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them. Here's an example of a service:


<b>7. Routing:</b></br>
Routing allows navigation between different components in an Angular application. Here's an example of routing configuration:


<b>8. Forms:</b></br>
Angular provides two approaches to handling forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms. Here's an example of a template-driven form:


<b>9. HTTP Client:</b></br>
Angular HTTP client is used to communicate with a server to fetch or post data. Here's an example of HTTP GET request:
