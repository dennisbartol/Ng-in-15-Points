# An overview of Angular 17 New Features

Introduced and maintained by Google, Angular 17, a popular front-end framework, is a testament to the Angular team’s relentless efforts in elevating the standards of software development.

The version 17 introduces never-seen-before optimizations, enhancements, and capabilities that every Angular Development Company is raving about. An example can be found right below.



<b>1. New built-in control flow</b>

Angular 17 Features include the introduction of a new declarative control mechanism, driving a sea change in how we manage templates.

Although @nglf has been the customary approach for rendering, the Angular Version 17 brings forth a syntax similar to what applied in JavaScript and Python. @for, @if and @switch have upended the traditional @nglf construct among more—a move seen as fulfilling a crucial need of the contemporary software development ecosystem. Not only do these modifications help build an easy-to-read code, but also significantly enhance its performance.

Let’s understand the new constructs with some examples:
 
<ul><li>if</li></ul>
Look at the example below to understand how the @nglf construct makes the code structure simpler, clearer, and more expressive—while eliminating the need of using extra tags or the ng-template tag.


<ul><li>for</li></ul>
 The @ngFor structure brings more clarity and a sense of precision compared to previous versions. In a fundamental addition, it requires the @track property, identical to frameworks like React and Vue, to assign a unique identifier to each time. It’s seen as the right step taken towards enhancing both element identification and the performance graph. 


<ul><li>switch</li></ul>
 The @ngSwitch structure allows for a clear code format, simplifying the way we express our conditions—while closely resembling JavaScript. The example below, based on the value of color, should be helpful in understanding the @switch structure better.

<b>2. Improved performance with esbuild</b>
 
The integration of esbuild dramatically improves the build speed and performance posture of Angular Development Services. A study of applications running on Angular 17 demonstrated an improvement of over 67% in build speed, making the latest version an even bigger drawcard for developers prioritizing efficiency. 

It’s almost effortless to switch from the traditional build system to esbuild using a simple modification in Angular.json file. Use the following code to do so:

"builder" : "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser-esbuild"

On completing the transition, developers can build business solutions with maximum efficiency and minimum turnaround time.
